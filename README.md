### Minecraft Plugin and Mod Developer

I develop Minecraft plugins and mods with a focus on improving gameplay, strengthening communities, and adding systems that encourage long-term engagement. My projects aim to provide server owners with reliable, well-documented tools and give players meaningful ways to interact beyond the standard game.

---

## Current Projects

* **ChatTracker** – A plugin for tracking, analyzing, and managing chat to help server owners moderate and improve community interaction.
* **YoFactions (in development)** – A modern, open-source factions plugin designed as an alternative to existing closed-source options. Focused on transparency, customization, and community-driven features.
* **Economy Plugins (planned)** – Tools for player-driven economies, including auction houses, marketplaces, and faction-based income systems.

## Areas of Focus

* Java development with Spigot and PaperMC APIs
* Faction and economy systems that encourage competitive but balanced gameplay
* Plugins designed around server communities, not just mechanics
* Open-source contributions and long-term support for server owners

---

## Collaboration and Services

I’m open to:

* Joint projects and collaborations with other developers
* Helping server owners with configuration, plugin setup, and troubleshooting
* Providing plugin development services, from custom features to full projects
* Contributing to open-source community projects in the Minecraft ecosystem

## Contact

I welcome feedback, collaboration opportunities, and new ideas. As my projects expand, I’ll be looking for contributors and testers who share the goal of building better tools for the Minecraft community.
